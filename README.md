# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

<h4>Rock vs. mine prediction using machine learning involves training a model to distinguish between rocks and mines based on various input features, typically derived from sonar data. This classification task is crucial in various fields, such as underwater navigation and defense, where identifying potential underwater hazards or objects of interest is vital. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines, decision trees, or neural networks, are employed to analyze patterns and characteristics in the data that differentiate rocks from mines. By training these models on labeled datasets where the true nature of the objects is known, the algorithms learn to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. This automated process enhances detection efficiency and accuracy, reduces the need for human intervention, and improves safety in underwater exploration and operations.<br>
